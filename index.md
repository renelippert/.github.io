# My favorite IT books.
## here the ones from IT Revolution

1. Agile Conversations
2. Team Topologies

These books have inspiered me a lot. They are now also part of my daily work life. I try to use the four two Rs as much as possible. They are record, reflect, revise, Role-Play and Repeat, Role Reversal.
