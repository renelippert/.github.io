# My favorite IT books.
## there are many good books from IT Revolution

eg. Agile Converstations

These books have inspiered me a lot. They are now also part of my daily work life. I try to use the four two Rs as much as possible. They are 
* record 
* reflect 
* revise 
* Role-Play
  * Repeat
  * Role Reversal.
