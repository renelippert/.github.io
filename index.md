# My favorite IT books.

These books have inspiered me a lot. They are now also part of my daily work life. I try to use the four two Rs as much as possible. They are record, reflect, revise, Role-Play and Repeat, Role Reversal.

## there are many good books from IT Revolution

eg. Agile Converstations
